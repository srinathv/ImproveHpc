</div>
<div id="contentblock">
<p>The compiler samples included with  Intel&reg; Fortran Compiler are designed to illustrate specific compiler optimizations, features, 
tools, and programming concepts.</p>
<p>Many of the samples are small, single source files intended to illustrate the 
associated concept in a general way. The sample sources contain the command line 
options and, where applicable, environment settings needed for compilation on 
Linux*, OS X*, and Windows*.</p>
<p>Some of these samples are meant to illustrate features during compilation 
only and do not result in executables.</p>

<td><p>Intel&rsquo;s compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel. Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended for use with Intel microprocessors. Certain optimizations not specific to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel microprocessors.
